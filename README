A quick hack to fill a number of USB sticks with music.

The tool assumes that the current dir holds a bunch of artist/album/ dirs.
At startup, it scans all albums and notes their size. Then, it will ask
you to specify the target device (push enter to see a fresh mount list).
Make sure to empty the target device before you enter it in (if you want).

After the last USB stick, just push ^C or ^D.

Tool does not keep state between runs!
